# Architecture Decision Records

Lightweight ADRs documenting significant technical decisions.

## Format

[Michael Nygard template](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions): Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives.

## Philosophy

> "Less is more" - Only document decisions worth preserving.

Detailed research lives in `/work/` (gitignored). ADRs distill the "why" for future reference.
